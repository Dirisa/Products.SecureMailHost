Hints for PloneLocalFolderNG and Mac OSX

PloneLocalFolderNG has several dependencies that are difficult to locate for Mac OSX, I thought I would list them here for the convenience of others. If anyone has any corrections or suggestions, please don't hesitate to send them my way.

1. Install TextIndexNG2
http://www.zope.org/Members/ajung/TextIndexNG

Place TextIndexNG2 inside the Products directory and make sure the permissions are set for the plone user!

/Applications/Plone2/Library/Software/Zope270/Python/bin/python setup.py install

I used Fink to install the unzip/zipinfo and xpdf utilities

XLHTML installs most of the dependencies required for wvWare. See below for installing xlhtml

	http://wvware.sourceforge.net/

TextIndexNG dependencies
-------------------------
 * system utils:
	- pptHtml:			pptHtml 0.4 (developer URL: http://chicago.sourceforge.net/xlhtml)
	- wvWare:			wvware 0.7.2 (developer URL: http://www.wvware.com)
	- pdftotext:		xpdf-3.00-win32 (developer URL: http://www.foolabs.com)

After adding the various dependencies, you should have these in your python/site-packages/ directory

	- indexsupport.pyd
	- Levenshtein.pyd
	- normalizer.pyd
	- Stemmer.pyd
	- TXNGSplitter.pyd

Now install xlhtml - download Mac OSX version from the URL below (the version is .5.1 as of the time of this writing) I was referred to this download site since I received an error from the xlhtml.org site. This worked fine. 

	http://nebuchadnezzar.zion.cz/xlhtml.php

cd into the directory => ./configure
				=> make check
				=> make install

Still need to install libwmf and wvware - I downloaded the i-Installer packages which provide a really nice installer for Mac OSX for the rest of these dependencies. Grab the i-Installer package from

For the i-Installer app, download this
	http://ii2.sourceforge.net/

For the latest i-Packages
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/ii2/
	
Using this I installed
* freetype2
* libwmf 
* wvWare

Everything should now be available to install as a Zope Product for TextIndexNG and ultimately PloneLocalFolderNG! 

==================================================
Specify directory path to PloneLocalFolderNG for Mac OSX

Note that when specifying a "local directory" name - be sure not to include the final slash, like this

	/Volumes/PathToFiles

if you add a trailing slash, an error will be generated! i.e. - DON"T DO THIS... 

		/Volumes/PathToFiles/
