Requirements:

  - Zope 2.6+, Plone 1.1 (2.0), Archetypes 1.0.X (Archetypes 1.1 and 1.2
    are not tested and *not* supported at this time)
 
  - The 'email' package of Python *must* be available. Either use Python 2.2.3
    for running Zope or get the 'email' package from Python 2.2.3 and install
    it in the PYTHONPATH of your Python 2.1.3 installation.

  - Plone 1.0.X is for now officially not supported. So use it at your own
    risk. A quick test showed that it seems to run without problems under
    Plone 1.0.5.


ATTENTION TO USERS of Plone 2.0 beta 3:

    portal_workflow has been removed in Plone 2b3 from the action provider list.
    This is a *big problem* and will be fixed in the next Plone release.
    To fix this:

       - remove the "deleteActionProvider()" call in 
         CMFPlone/setup/ConfigurationMethods.py line 175

       - *recreate* your Plone 2.0 site (if created *with* Plone 2.0 beta 3)

       - there is currently no support from my side to re-enable the
         portal_workflow as action provider for Plone sites created under Plone 2.0 beta 3

Installation:
 
  - visit the ZMI screeen of Plone site and go to the portal_quickinstaller
    tool 

  - select the checkboxes for PloneCollectorNG (and Archetypes) and press
    'Install'

  - select "Plone Collector NG" from the add-list of the folder_contents view
    of a folder and create a new instance

  You can also use the Plone frontend. Go to "Plone setup". Choose
  "Add/remove products" and select "PloneCollectorNG" to be installed. That's
  it.
