Requirements:

  - Zope 2.6+, Plone 2.0 (1.X untested), Archetypes 1.3 (CVS HEAD) (Archetypes
    1.2.X is *NOT SUPPORTED*)
 
  - The 'email' package of Python *must* be available. Either use Python 2.2.3
    for running Zope or get the 'email' package from Python 2.2.3 and install
    it in the PYTHONPATH of your Python 2.1.3 installation.

  - Plone 1.0.X is for now officially not supported. So use it at your own
    risk. A quick test showed that it seems to run without problems under
    Plone 1.0.5.

    WARNING: future versions of PloneCollectorNG might use advanced features
    of Plone 2.0 that are not backward compatible with Plone 1.X installations.
    There will be absolutely *NO* support to migrate your PloneCollectorNG
    installation from Plone 1 to Plone 2.


  Optional packages:

   - PlacelessTranslationService - PTS (sf.net/projects/collective)

   - Reportlab (www.reportlab.org) - required for PDF output
  
   - PIL (Python Imaging Library) required to include uploaded images
     in the PDF output

   - Graphviz (www.graphivz.org) to produced dependency tree for 
     issue references


ATTENTION TO USERS of Plone 2.0 beta 3:

    portal_workflow has been removed in Plone 2b3 from the action provider list.
    This is a *big problem* and will be fixed in the next Plone release.
    To fix this:

       - remove the "deleteActionProvider()" call in 
         CMFPlone/setup/ConfigurationMethods.py line 175

       - *recreate* your Plone 2.0 site (if created *with* Plone 2.0 beta 3)

       - there is currently no support from my side to re-enable the
         portal_workflow as action provider for Plone sites created under
         Plone 2.0 beta 3

Installation:
 
  - visit the ZMI screeen of Plone site and go to the portal_quickinstaller
    tool 

  - select the checkboxes for PloneCollectorNG (and Archetypes) and press
    'Install'

  - select "Plone Collector NG" from the add-list of the folder_contents view
    of a folder and create a new instance

  You can also use the Plone frontend. Go to "Plone setup". Choose
  "Add/remove products" and select "PloneCollectorNG" to be installed. That's
  it. 

Internationalization support:

  - Requires the installation of PlacelessTranslationService (Localizer
    /TranslationService might work too, no support)

  - included language catalogs: DE 

  - to translate the catalog to another language:

    o copy i18n/plonecollectorng-de.po to i18n/plonecollectorng-XX.po
      (where XX is the shortcut for the destination language)

    o translate all msgstr "..." in the copied file

    o create a .mo file for your language:

       msgfmt -o plonecollectorng-XX.mo plonecollectorng-XX.po

    o send me a copy of your translated .po file for inclusion with
      the next PloneCollectorNG release

    o restart Zope and enjoy :-)
