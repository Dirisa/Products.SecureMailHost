Requirements:

  - Zope 2.6+, Plone 2.0 (1.X untested), Archetypes 1.0.X (Archetypes 1.1 and
    1.2 are not tested and *not* supported at this time. Also see Archetypes
    section below)
 
  - The 'email' package of Python *must* be available. Either use Python 2.2.3
    for running Zope or get the 'email' package from Python 2.2.3 and install
    it in the PYTHONPATH of your Python 2.1.3 installation.

  - Plone 1.0.X is for now officially not supported. So use it at your own
    risk. A quick test showed that it seems to run without problems under
    Plone 1.0.5.

    WARNING: future versions of PloneCollectorNG might use advanced features
    of Plone 2.0 that are not backward compatible with Plone 1.X installations.
    There will be absolutely *NO* support to migrate your PloneCollectorNG
    installation from Plone 1 to Plone 2.


  Optional packages:

   - PlacelessTranslationService - PTS (sf.net/projects/collective)

   - Reportlab (www.reportlab.org) - required for PDF output
  
   - PIL (Python Imaging Library) required to include uploaded images
     in the PDF output

   - Graphviz (www.graphivz.org) to produced dependency tree for 
     issue references


ATTENTION TO USERS of Plone 2.0 beta 3:

    portal_workflow has been removed in Plone 2b3 from the action provider list.
    This is a *big problem* and will be fixed in the next Plone release.
    To fix this:

       - remove the "deleteActionProvider()" call in 
         CMFPlone/setup/ConfigurationMethods.py line 175

       - *recreate* your Plone 2.0 site (if created *with* Plone 2.0 beta 3)

       - there is currently no support from my side to re-enable the
         portal_workflow as action provider for Plone sites created under Plone 2.0 beta 3

Installation:
 
  - visit the ZMI screeen of Plone site and go to the portal_quickinstaller
    tool 

  - select the checkboxes for PloneCollectorNG (and Archetypes) and press
    'Install'

  - select "Plone Collector NG" from the add-list of the folder_contents view
    of a folder and create a new instance

  You can also use the Plone frontend. Go to "Plone setup". Choose
  "Add/remove products" and select "PloneCollectorNG" to be installed. That's
  it. 

Internationalization support:

  - Requires the installation of PlacelessTranslationService (Localizer
    /TranslationService might work too, no support)

  - included language catalogs: DE 

  - to translate the catalog to another language:

    o copy i18n/plonecollectorng-de.po to i18n/plonecollectorng-XX.po
      (where XX is the shortcut for the destination language)

    o translate all msgstr "..." in the copied file

    o create a .mo file for your language:

       msgfmt -o plonecollectorng-XX.mo plonecollectorng-XX.po

    o send me a copy of your translated .po file for inclusion with
      the next PloneCollectorNG release

    o restart Zope and enjoy :-) 


Support for Archetypes 1.2:
  
    PCNG 1.0 has been designed for AT 1.0 only. Although a *very rough* test
    with AT 1.2 shows that PCNG 1.0 seem to work with AT 1.2 with the
    following changes:

     - add the following lines to the collector_schema.py file (this
       should allow you to use the "Browse" functionality for issues):

        
        DateTimeField('expirationDate',
                    schemata='metadata',
                    ),

     - go to the "Schema Editor" and add two new fields "subject" and
       "language" to the 'issuedata' schemata. Then update the schema for all
       issues and restart Zope.

    This changes will be incorporated into a later PCNG release (very likely
    1.0.1). Use AT 1.2 with PCNG 1.0.0 at YOUR OWN RISK.  I don't not gurantee
    that the changes above work or do not break in a later release.
