Requirements:

  - Zope 2.6+, Plone 1.1 (2.0), Archetypes 1.0 (tested)
 
  - The 'email' package of Python *must* be available. Either use Python 2.2.3
    for running Zope or get the 'email' package from Python 2.2.3 and install
it in the PYTHONPATH of your Python 2.1.3 installation.

  - Plone 1.0.X is for now officially not supported. So use it at your own
    risk. A quick test showed that it seems to run without problems under
    Plone 1.0.5.

Installation:
 
  - visit the ZMI screeen of Plone site and go to the portal_quickinstaller
    tool 

  - select the checkboxes for PloneCollectorNG (and Archetypes) and press
    'Install'

  - select "Plone Collector NG" from the add-list of the folder_contents view
    of a folder and create a new instance
