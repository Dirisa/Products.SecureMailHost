Requirements:

  - Zope 2.6+, Plone 1.1 (2.0), Archetypes 1.0 (tested)
 
  - The 'email' package of Python *must* be available. Either
    use Python 2.2.3 for running Zope or get the 'email' package
    from Python 2.2.3 and install it in the PYTHONPATH of your
    Python 2.1.3 installation.

  - Plone 1.0.X is for now officially not supported. So use it
    at your own risk. A quick test showed at it seems to run
    problems under Plone 1.0.5.

Installation:
 
  - go the portal_quickinstaller tool of your Plone site

  - select the checkboxes for PloneCollectorNG (and Archetypes)
    and press 'Install'

  - select "Plone Collector NG" from the add-list of the folder_contents
    view of a folder and create a new instance
