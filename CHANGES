v0_2 - 20030331

  * Users are now acquired correctly, which prevents you from hotfixing anything !!! :-)

  * This fixed Zope 2.5 w/ Plone bug

  * Better log reporting

  * Validated with LDAPUserFolder and SimpleUserFolder

v0_1 - 20021126

  * User creation is now supported

  * Fixed a bug (with an axe) that prevented Zope module Owner.py code to work.
    The Owner.py calls aq_inner and aq_parent methods on a User object to get its
    security context. So it found the underlying User object instead of the GRUF 
    itself. So we fixed this by setting dummy UserFolder-context methods on the
    GRUFUser objects. This is ugly and should be fixed later by acquiring the 
    underlying User object from a better context.

  * Fixed getUserName in GRUFUser that returned group names without "group_"
  
  * Fixed various "cosmetic" bugs

  * Documented the whole stuff
