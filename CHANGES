    2004/03/10 Maik Röder

  * Speedup improvements by Heldge Tesdal

  * Fixed ZMI overview refreshing bug

  * GroupsTool method createGrouparea now calls the GroupSpace
    method setInitialGroup with the group that it is created for.
    In case this method does not exists, the default behaviour
    is employed. This is done so that the GroupSpace can decide on its
    own what the policy should be regarding the group that it is 
    initially created for.
    See the implementation of GrufSpaces for an example of how this
    can be used in order to give the initial group the role GroupMember.

v0_2 - 20030331

  * Better log reporting

  * Validated with LDAPUserFolder and SimpleUserFolder

v0_1 - 20021126

  * User creation is now supported

  * Fixed a bug (with an axe) that prevented Zope module Owner.py code to work.
    The Owner.py calls aq_inner and aq_parent methods on a User object to get its
    security context. So it found the underlying User object instead of the GRUF 
    itself. So we fixed this by setting dummy UserFolder-context methods on the
    GRUFUser objects. This is ugly and should be fixed later by acquiring the 
    underlying User object from a better context.

  * Fixed getUserName in GRUFUser that returned group names without "group_"
  
  * Fixed various "cosmetic" bugs

  * Documented the whole stuff
