TO DO
-----
* Debug.  In particular, the getRoles/setRoles functions need some
work.  They need to do a better job of handling automatically added roles
such as Authenticated.  They also need a bit of rethinking when the
user comes from an acl_users folder that is not portal.acl_users.

* Workflows.  Right now the only available workflow requires that
a Manager review and approve each new member.  (I need this for a client
project)  We should have a few additional workflows that replicate the
default Plone user management scenarios (e.g. anybody can register and
set their own passwords immediately; anybody can register, but passwords
are mailed to them; private site)

* Build in a real search that uses the catalog.  The current search
just uses the existing plone member search mechanism, which is dog slow.
I think lalo is doing some automatic search page generation stuff, so
this might be really simple.

* Refactor.  It would be nice to separate out a MemberDataBase class
from which potential member classes can inherit.

* Deletion confirmations.  There should be a "do you really want
to do this?" confirmation before you delete a member, since all their
content gets nuked as well.  Additionally, there should be the option
to assign ownership of their content to somebody else.

* Better UI for the Member state tab.  Currently it uses the same
page as for publishing documents, which is completely inappropriate.

* Integrate with Group User Folder.  I haven't looked at GUF at all,
but I'm hoping that this won't be too involved, since the user folder
is in theory more or less orthogonal to member data.
