Remaining to do:

General:

- Include help templates that explain what the different parts do, how
  a FAQ differs from a howto, differs from a Tutorial etc.

- Search needs to be hooked up! It should allow searching on all the different
  types. (limi)

- Notify! People need to be notified when somebody adds a comment to their item,
  so they can maintain and refine. The PloneHelpCenter concept will not work 
  without this, IMHO. (limi)

- Make it easier to choose which subcomponents get installed. For
  example, put a simple textual list in config.py of the folderish
  products, and have types/init.py, Install.py, and
  HelpCenter.py/__init__ respect this. Easier for other people who
  want to use product but might not want all parts.

I18n:

- Some initial stuff has been put into to many types, but not always
  consistently. Can someone very familiar with i18n step up here?


Versions:

- Add UI to folder screens to only show content for selected versions.
  Alllows Plone 1.0 people,for example, to see only stuff pertaining
  to them. (limi)

- Also need a way to set the default view help-center-wide 
  (Example, let's say we just want to show Plone 2.0 elements 
   in the listings) (limi)


Unit tests:

- We need some!





DONE:

- Consider having an "Important" marker on entries, to mark the most
  common ones visually with a red (!) marker in the overview/listing.

  - I think we can/should generalize this more: add a ImportanceVocab
    list to help center for list of importance raitings, ie,
    ('Important','Normal') Then folder skins can just sort based on
    the order that things are listed in the importance ratings, and
    add the red bang to the top-level ones. This gives us more
    flexibility for future importance ratings. [Joel]

  - I have added an importance field to all the content schema.  The vocabulary
    is defined in config.py.  [Geoff]

- We should have an extra attribute that has additional words that are
  indexed along with the content - for example in a howto about
  VerboseSecurity, it would make sense to have:

  - Verbose Security

  - Insufficient Privileges (the Plone Error Message)

  - Debugging security problems

  - etc...

  - I have added a related_keywords field to all the content schemata.  The
    contents get indexed along with the rest of the item's searchable text. 
    [Geoff]

- Integrate with the ratings tool

  - Being developed as a separate product.

- Add simple Glossary type, with Glossary entries (already added by limi)

  - I admit that it's 50% because we have 5 and not 6 different
    types now, which makes everything asymmetrical. ;)

  - I still think it could be useful though - say; define what an
    action is, have an Archetypes section with stuff like
    Schema, Schemata, they are referencable from other docs.
    Makes a nice print-out for newbies too. :)

  - Simple container folder, like the others - with Sections

  - Super-simple object that is essentially a definition list

  - No item-level rendering is really necessary, but anchors are
    important. Everything can probably be on one page if anchors
    are included, and visible as bookmarkable links.

  - Advanced-level functionality (pie-in-the-sky) is automatic 
    parsing of abbr tags to look in the glossary for entries.
    (not realistic at this stage, just a fun thought :) - lots
    of academic institutions would like something like this, with
    proper integration in Kupu it could be killer functionality. :)
