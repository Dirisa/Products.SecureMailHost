PloneSoftwareCenter - Remaining issues before 1.0

Developer claiming item/comments is in [brackets].

=========================
Pre-deployment count-down
=========================

- Company logo isn't shown at the moment.

- May want to re-order expected release date, feature freeze date and PLIP 
    freeze date in release schema - at present, they are listed in reverse
    chronological order, so to speak (i.e. feature freeze comes before release,
    but the release date field comes before the freeze date).
 
- by-category.pt shows the category short name, should show full name (but
  requires that you pass in short name and get back full name, since we pull
  short name from last element in URL)
  
- by-category.pt fails miserably when no category is specified, it should
  redirect to parent URL in that case - not show index out of range error.

- by-category.pt results should be sorted by latest release first, right now
  it's listing latest project added first, I believe - which is not what we
  want. The projects doing frequest releases should come first.

- PSCProject has a currentVersions field to list supported versions (for PHC
    support). We could use this to show a portalMessage on unsupported
    releases if we want coupling between documentation-supported releases
    and generally-supported releases. Condition would be:
    
        tal:condition="python:here.getId() not in here.getCurrentVersions()"

- May want to santity-check that release date is after feature freeze date is
    after plip freeze date (trivial validators)
    
- May want to actually enforce plip freeze date - widget label seems to imply 
    this (how to hide field?)

- Now that we have data grids on licenses etc., we should probably clean it up
  a bit in the view templates for releases  (show links etc.)

====
Misc
====

- DOAP feed support (Description of a Project)
  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-osproj3/
  - This will require us to expand the Software Project schema (Package)
    a bit, to incorporate info about CVS/SVN etc, but it's all useful. :)

- RSS feed for Latest Releases, ability to have an RSS feed for every project
  and category too.

- i18n revision - first cut was added but there's some corners remaining.

- Hard for regular members to find Package after it's been created, before
  it's been published 
  
    -> Standard problem in Plone in general without Workspaces ~limi

==========
Re-enable?
==========

- Display of "recommended" in psc_project_view.pt and psc_releasefolder_view.pt.
    How does "recommended" work anyway? (Reviewers can flag something as a best-
    of-breed product, but we need some guidelines for this first. ~limi.
    Absolutely we need some guidelines here, or it's going to be a bloody
    political mess. - Joel
    Indeed, that's why I haven't put any effort into this part yet ;) - limi)

    -> Commented this out for now to avoid confusion ~optilude

==========================================
PloneHelpCenter integration considerations
==========================================

 - Test carefully that all the methods/fields found on the PHC root and used
    as vocabs for contained objects are found in PSC as well, or that they
    are only optionally used.

        - DC metadata 'rights' attribute gets acquired from project/package

        - Importance vocabulary falls back on default Low, Medium, High

        - Versions vocab for PHC items (not the same as versions vocab for
            releases, which relate to which version of Plone it's been
            tested with!) use a catalog search of all releases, in custom
            method getVersions_vocab () in PSCProject.

        - Active versions set in field on PSCProject.


========================
Nice-to-have-but-not-yet
========================

Stuff that should be there eventually - but is probably better handled by Plone(Forge|Collab):

- DOAP feed support (Description of a Project)
  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-osproj3/
  - This will require us to expand the Software Project schema (Package)
    a bit, to incorporate info about CVS/SVN etc, but it's all useful. :)

- Mailing list/discussion forums inside of ArchPackages

- Have a marshaller for 'Release'. When you upload a .tgz, .zip, .bz2
  file, it should try to extract the PKGINFO, or maybe setup.py and
  populate the objects.

- Maybe have a custom setup.py that is able to register with plone.org
  and populate the objects (also doing upload, and asking for username
  and password).

- SVN integration, you could be able to do the following:

  - Tag a release in the SVN repository

  - Add a release in Plone

  - Select which tag you want the release to be based on

  - Automatically get tar.gz and .zip files for the release

Dependencies, here's Sidnei's comments:

- Add a 'dependencies' tab to release, that shows the existing
  dependencies on a nice layout and allows for adding a dependency
  directly if the user has permission to do so.

- Filter the 'versions' for a choosen package on 'Dependency', as soon
  as the user chooses a package (maybe using javascript?)

- Add pluggable content creation to a 'Package' (or is that a
  'Release'?), so that an instance of a given object is created and
  initialized as soon as the user creates the object. This should also
  be allowed to change after the object has been added (only allowed
  to enable new features, not disable?).
