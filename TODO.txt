- There is a security problem when trying to view a FAQ section

- The FAQ folder lists all FAQs in every section - it shouldn't do that. :)

- We should populate the Sections attribute with 'General' so there is a section available at all times.

- We should use Keywords (DublinCore Subject) for the Sections, and restrict the usage to only being the ones defined in the folder (is this possible?)

- We should use Description for the full Question attribute in FAQ.py, not a dedicated attribute.

- We should have an extra attribute that has additional words that are indexed along with the content - for example in a howto about VerboseSecurity, it would make sense to have:

  - Verbose Security

  - Insufficient Privileges (the Plone Error Message)

  - Debugging security problems

  - etc...

- All content types should be Discussable

- Workflows & Permissions

  - Any logged in user should be able to add a FAQ/HowTo/Tutorial

  - The content is not visible or searchable to anybody else than the Reviewers/Managers before it is Published

  - There is no 'visible state', available states are:

    - Private

    - Pending

    - Published

    - Obsolete

  - Transitions should be pretty self-explanatory:

    - User creates content object (state=private)

    - User has checkmark in the add form that says "Submit for approval immediately" so they don't have to worry about the state menu (state="pending")

    - Reviewer sees content in queue, checks content + sections/versions, answers the question if it's a relevant Question without an Answer, publishes. (state="published")

    - Ideally, every time someone adds a comment to an item, the owner of it gets a mail containing the comment + content URL.

    - The Obsolete state is for later, when the ratings tool can push something into an obsolete status if 3 or more people have marked the content wrong/obsolete. The Owner should then get a mail about it.
