TO DO
-----
I have gotten the code working at various points, but with all that 
I've done recently, I'm not sure it still works.

* Grant Add Portal Content permission to anonymous within
  portal_memberdata

* Grant new CMFMember perms to appropriate roles  

* Find out why workflow transitions are executing for partially
  created Member objects

* Set initial non-empty passwords

* Find out why temp/ stuff remained in zodb

* Make sure the code actually works.  Main untested code: member 
deletion and renaming, all workflow methods.  There really should
be unit tests.  I have started some (see tests/).

* Wire up registration to use the new member creation.  (I am planning
to clean up portal_factory so we don't end up with a bunch of half-
created members lying around.)  Registration should be able to just
use base_edit but we'll need to put in some explanatory text.

* Put in a search page.  Ideally the search page will show up as
portal_metadata's index_html page.  It would be nice if the results
looked like folder_contents so you could search for a member and
delete them.  The search should make use of the catalog to the
extent possible.  I think lalo is doing some automatic search page 
generation stuff, so this might be really simple.

* Additional delete options.  There should be a "do you really want
to do this?" confirmation before you delete a member, since all their
content gets nuked as well.  Additionally, there should be the option
to assign ownership of their content to somebody else.

* Add a disable member function.  Disabled members should not be able
to log in.

* Modify registration tool's send password method to check Member perms.

* Create pending member worklists.

* Refactor.  It would be nice to separate out a MemberDataBase class
from which potential member classes can inherit.

* Add documentation to base_view, base_edit.  This will probably require
some minor Archetypes mods, e.g. creating an EmptyField class.  [Ben has
just added a better Description() method -- need to look into it as a
better way.]

---
* Auto-register an unregistered user when wrapUser is called since
the user already exists in acl_users (I think).

* Add listed in.  The listed variable can be set by the register()
  method and then by some method that is called after the make_public /
  make_private transitions are executed.

* Add portraits in.
