The following is a TODO list dealing with PLFNG features and bugs.
It is organized into these categories:

  "KNOWN ISSUES"

  "BEFORE NEXT RELEASE (0.50)" (items that are on the critical path)

  "BEFORE RELEASE 0.60" (items that are not on the immediate
  critical path, but should be worked soon)
  
  "BEFORE 1.0 FINAL" (items that are not yet allocated to a
  pre-1.0 release, but must be done before the big v1.0 release.
  
  "MAYBE NEVER BUT NICE TO HAVE" (items that are not yet on any 
  critical path)


As you find bugs in PLFNG, please submit them to 
the 'Collective' sourceforge project bug tracker:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=55262&atid=476390

(the Collective is the official home for PLFNG and a variety
of other Plone products)

Also, feel free to email me (mgarnsey@users.sourceforge.net)
about feature requests and/or to volunteer to help!!! 


----------------------------------
  KNOWN ISSUES
----------------------------------

- bug # 971432: 'Adding a Local Folder ends up in a error'
   (AT 1.3.0b2 incompatibility issue)

- bug # 988620: rejected upload of file with same name 
   as existing file results in deletion of existing file
   
- bug # 990294: PLFNG objects appear twice in Nav tree 
 (for admin user)

- directory creation succeeds but gives an error
   message (not found 404) on Windows 
   (not reproducable yet) 

- empty folders give 404 errors for anonymous

- the add new item menu should be disabled, since 
    plone types cannot be added to a PLFNG

- i18n not complete.

- various problems with filenames containing spaces
  (need to quantify this)

----------------------------------
  BEFORE NEXT RELEASE (0.50)
----------------------------------
Significant enhancements have been put into the 0.50 baseline,
and we really need to get them officially released!


----------------------------------
  BEFORE RELEASE 0.60
----------------------------------
- bug #971432: 'Adding a Local Folder ends up in a error'
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=971432&group_id=55262&atid=476390

- bug # 988620: rejected upload of file with same name 
   as existing file results in deletion of existing file
   
- bug # 990294: PLFNG objects appear twice in Nav tree

- resolve any problems wrt filenames containing spaces

- better docs! (specifics tbd)

- rework file uploads so that they are temporarily stored
  with a temporary filename to facilitate checking 
  (MD5, quota limit, archive integrity, etc). 
  
- add revisioning metadata for files
  (to include who/when uploaded file) 

- add optional support for archiving old revisions of files
  (eg, place copy of file into a *.old folder when file
   is deleted or when new revision of file is uploaded)

- improve the unit testing for catalog action


----------------------------------
  BEFORE 1.0 FINAL
----------------------------------

tbd

----------------------------------
 MAYBE NEVER BUT NICE TO HAVE
----------------------------------

- multi-file select for group action (eg, delete)

- virus scanning of uploaded files

- id / track changes to folder contents

- This probably has *nothing* to do with the PloneLocalFolderNG 
product, but when using a GUI editor (i.e. - Epoz), the "toolbox" which 
provides nice placeholders that make it easy to link to or display an 
image, the PloneLocalFolder content doesn't appear like other content.
This may be too much trouble to consider implementing, but it 
might be something to put as a "caveat" in the README file.

- make path elements clickable (like breadcrumbs)

- sort content across multiple page listings

- filter contents lists by type, size, ???

- comments for folders

- ability to hide files (e.g. 'dot' files like .DS_Store on OSX)

- move file and/or folder 

- unpacking support for package types other than .zip (eg .tgz) file types

- display all metadata (partially implemented now)

- edit all metadata 

- ability to generate MD5 checksum metadata for existing files

- ability to verify current file MD5 checksum against metadata MD5 value
