PloneHelpCenter - remaining issues

Bugs
====

  - BUG: Howtos seem to not pick up the 'versions' defined in the Help Center.
         Check that this works for all content types.

        -> Appears fixed (optilude)
          
  - BUG: Contents tab is visible to normal Members (at least on plone.org)
         - it shouldn't be.
    
        -> Appears fixed (optilude)
  
  - BUG: Owners can't edit their content when it has been published. They should
         be able to do this, we don't want to have the retract/edit/re-publish
         dance.
         
        -> I'm having some trouble here... I can't add content at all as
        a regular member. I'm getting insufficient privileges, though I can't
        see why. VerboseSecurity and portal_workflow seem to be in disagreement.
        joel suggests this may be fixed by having the latest version of
        PortalFormControoler. (optilude)
          
  - BUG: Comments on TutorialPages end up on the containerish Tutorial object
         instead, at least on plone.org. It should be possible to add a comment
         to a page.
         
         -> Appears fixed (optilude)
  
  - BUG: RSS feed doesn't work (fix was committed, needs testing, especially with 
         foreign character sets and UTF-8 chars)
    
        -> XXX: Not yet tested (optilude)
  
  - BUG: error_reference object has "wrong attachments" tab

         Note the path here - we're calling the howto_attachments!

         /aPloneSite/myHelpCenter/error/anErrorref/howto_attachments

         I get this wrong behavior, when trying to view the
         Attachments tab after creating a *error reference*
         
         -> Fixed now (optilude)

Fixes
====

  - "Error on howto_attachments "name 'translate' is not defined"

         FYI: I get the above error when trying to view the
         attachements tab when writing a howto."
         
         -> Appears fixed (optilude)

  - BUG: Owners can't mark their own content Obsolete, they should be able to.

         FYI: I ALSO get the above error when trying to view the
         attachements tab, after creating a *error reference*

        -> Appears fixed (optilude)

=======
General
=======

  - PHC needs a Comment workflow! Priority #1, explained near the bottom of 
    this document. ("Comment notifications")
    
        -> XXX: Not tested, but assume this is done? (optilude)
  
  - All content types need Sharing tab
  
        -> Appears done (optilude)
  
  - HistoryAware mix-in - PHC types should have a history attached, so we can
    mount a non-packable storage on plone.org that will keep all the change
    history for documentation content types. ATContentTypes already has this.
  
        -> Done, though not always sensible values to test, since some fields
            use metadata only (answer in Description) and this doesn't seem
            to be versioned in the ZODB (optilude)
  
  - I have removed workflow for TutorialPage (~limi), but we might consider a
    visible/hidden scheme, so you can have pages that you're adding while the
    Tutorial is available.
    
        -> TODO: Not yet done (optilude)
   
  - The help center template should list any other normal folders put into it, 
    so you can add stuff that is just plain folders, like on plone.org.
    
        -> XXX: Not yet tested (optilude)

  - Ideally, the "How to contribute to/use this resource" (phc_help) should be a 
    pre-populated howto itself, so it can be translated/modified to suit the
    particular use case.
    
        -> TODO: Not yet done (optilude)
    
  - Add LinguaPlone support to the types

    - The LinguaPlone import statement

    - Declare relevant fields as language-independent
  
  
        -> XXX: Not yet tested (optilude)
  
  - The view templates for listings (howto, tutorial, faq etc - all of them)
    should only display *published* items, even if you have the permissions
    to see the others.
  
    Items that are "in-progress" are currently visible in the listings - they do
    not show up on the main PHC page, though. The correct behaviour is that it 
    should not show up for people who don't have the permission to see them
    (ie. Anon, Member) until they are published. "In-progress" and 
    "Pending" should both only be visible to Owner, Manager and in the
    case of "Pending" - also to the Reviewer role.
  
    ADDENDUM: It seems these are using object listings instead of catalog
              searches - which is not optimal. If we make them catalog-
              powered, they will be able to color-code themselves, and not
              wake up all the content objects as a bonus. ;)

    ADDENDUM2: This requires ordering support in catalog, so we have to fix it
               to not show content that isn't published for now, and we can do
               the Catalog-based queries once Plone 2.1 with catalog-ordering is
               out.
  
        -> TODO: Can still see in-progress items as manager (optilude)
  
  - Search needs to be hooked up! It should allow searching on all the different
    types. Almost done, it doesn't search the Glossary at the moment, it seems.
    This needs proper testing, the search seems to not be indexing things properly
    at the moment - searching the PHC on plone.org is a miserable experience. :]
  
        -> XXX: Not yet tested (optilude)
  
  - Expose "Contributors" in the main edit screen instead of on Properties tab, if
    possible. It's going to be used a lot :)
    
        -> TODO: Not yet done (optilude)
  
  - The "Obsolete" state has non-obvious name for the transition to pull it back
    into play.
  
        -> TODO: Not yet done (optilude)
    
  - A way to set PHC-wide default Rights attribute - on plone.org we want 
    everything to be under the same license, for example. Maybe look at
    PloneCC which is a product to add Creative Commons licenses.
    http://woss.name/software/PloneCC/ (no idea if this is relevant or not)
  
        -> XXX: Unsure what this means, but doesn't appear to be done (optilude)
  
  - Definitions (in Glossary) need to be able to have Rich Text - the way it is
    now, it can't have links to other definitions. The Description attribute 
    should be this field, just rendered to Plain Text. If this is too much work,
    having the "See also" thing so we can link to other definitions is also an
    option. (Actually - probably a better option, as it is less susceptible to
    link rot, since it's an AT reference)
    
        -> TODO: Not yet done (optilude)
  
  - Definitions (glossary_view template) should be alphabetically sorted - 
    proper human sorting, not UNIX-sorting (ie. not uppercase letters before 
    lowercase).
    
        -> TODO: Not yet done (optilude)
  
  - Description should be required *everywhere*, the listings make very little sense
    without this.
  
        -> Appears done (optilude)
  
  - Integrate with the ATRatings tool - we want ratings on content. If we get a
    basic rating UI going, Limi will try to step up with an improved JS version. 
    We need the initial implementation in place first, though. :)
  
        -> TODO: Not yet done (optilude)
  
  - Importance: I think we can/should generalize this more: add a ImportanceVocab
    list to help center for list of importance raitings, ie,
    ('Important','Normal') Then folder skins can just sort based on
    the order that things are listed in the importance ratings, and
    add the red bang to the top-level ones. This gives us more
    flexibility for future importance ratings. --Joel
    
        -> TODO: Not yet done (optilude)

=================================
Movie and Movie Area content type
=================================

  Contains instructional flash videos.
  
    -> Appears done, though why are we limiting to Flash videos only? Also,
    doesn't appear to be using external storage, which we probably want.
    (optilude)
  
  - Based off the How-to type (needs to be folderish) - same type of general listing, with categories in the container etc.
  
  - For each movie, show: 
  
    - title

    - file size

    - description

    - and *perhaps* an image of a screenshot

  - A Movie is a series of files

  Advanced:

  - The controller is an xml file
  
  - One approach:

    1. Get author to upload a ZIP

    2. The content type opens the zip, parses the controller XML, keeps the SWF

    3. Throws out everything else

    4. Generates the controller XML on the fly, contains:

      - what is the screen dimensions of the &lt;object&gt;

      - metadata

  - Benefits:

    - you snarf metadata from the XML, not re-enter it

    - minidom could handle this one 

    The alternative is to just use the layout that Camtasia produces (the generated HTML)

===============================
"Reference Manual" content type
===============================
 
    -> Done in PHC-reference-guide-branch (optilude)
 
  For book-type manuals and individual products' documentation needs.
  
  - Add tests, test properly
  
    -> well, not this part :)


=====================
Comment notifications
=====================

    -> XXX: Not yet tested (optilude)

  People need to be notified when somebody adds a comment to their item,
  so they can maintain and refine. The PloneHelpCenter concept will not work 
  without this, IMHO.
    
  Overview:
  
  1. Author adds documentation, it is published.
  
  2. Reader finds documentation, adds comment.
  
  3. Author gets mail: "Somebody added a comment to documentation you have added,
     please go here [URL] and incorporate the comment in the docs, if needed"
  
  4. Author incorporates comment in documentation, if relevant and useful. Author can edit owned content in-place after initial publication, no need for another submit/publish cycle.
  
  5. Author removes the comment
  
  In essence, we need a workflow called CommentNotifyWorkflow that does the
  following:
  
  a) If comment is added to content, sends mail to author of document
  
  b) If somebody adds reply to a comment, it notifies the first comment poster (I
     assume this can be done the same way (sending mail to owner of parent), just
     want to make sure this use case is covered too)
  
  The following patch was committed to the CMF 1.4.x branch, but didn't make the
  1.4.7 release. If you want workflow on comments, you need this patch, as 
  DiscussionItems do not use the factory::

===========================
Versions (not versioning ;)
===========================

  - Add a way to set the "current" version(s) of the release - this way, we
    can automatically display a portalMessage box on content that says:
    "This content is only relevant to Plone 1.0. The current version is
     Plone 2.0. Make sure you are using the correct version before
     following the instructions given here."
     
        -> TODO: Not done (optilude)
  
  - Nice to have: A way to set the default view help-center-wide 
    (Example, let's say we just want to show Plone 2.0 elements 
     in the listings) (limi)


==========
Unit tests
==========

    - Need tests for RSS feed and foreign and UTF-8 chars.

    - Need tests for searching

    - We need more tests!

        -> Word (optilude)

=========
Design/UI
=========

  - All PHC types need to show the "log in to add FAQ/How-to/whatever" button
  
    -> TODO: Not done (optilude)
  
  - Howtos need to have a note about the fact that they are folderish and can
    contain images/files
  
    -> TODO: Not done (optilude)
  
  - Discreet "Powered by PHC" in footer
  
    -> TODO: Not done, but why do we care? (optilude)
  
  - A portlet to show content that hasn't been modified in 6 months - so we can go 
    in and see if it's still relevant. We'll just hit save if it is, this is a
    simple way of making sure content is reviewed periodically.
  
    -> Appears done (optilude)
  
  - Include the Documentation review portlet from plone.org
  
    -> XXX: No idea if this is done or not (optilude)
  
  - Tutorial Page Pulldown needs to show the existing page as selected
  
    -> XXX: Not yet tested. If it's missing there, it's also missing on the
    refrence manual type (optilude)
    
========================
Nice-to-have-but-not-yet
========================

  - Make it easier to choose which subcomponents get installed. For
    example, put a simple textual list in config.py of the folderish
    products, and have types/init.py, Install.py, and
    HelpCenter.py/__init__ respect this. Easier for other people who
    want to use product but might not want all parts.
  
  Saving content as PDF:
  
  - It could be possible to save the longer content (howtos, tutorials)
    as a PDF file for easier archival and printing. A small PDF icon
    can be placed next to the email/print icons, and when clicked on
    generates a PDF version of the page, minus all the navigation.
    We could perhaps use the plonePrint.css to generate a nice looking PDF.
  
    Joel Burton reports good success with htmldoc for converting well-formed HTML 
    to decent PDFs. 
  
    Another possibility is to use CMFReportTool by Ulrich Eck <ueck@net-labs.de>,
    which can serve dynamically generated PDF-Documents for every content-object 
    of your CMF/Plone-Site. It uses PageTemplates to generate a XML-Document 
    (syntax is called PML) that is rendered to PDF using reportlabs platypus 
    layout-engine. http://www.zope.org/Members/jack-e/CMFReportTool

==========================
Workflow specs - reference
==========================

(by limi, trying to capture the most important things :)

- The main Plone Help Center *Content* workflow has the following states:

  - In-progress [Only Owner + Managers can View and Edit]
  
  - Pending [Owner can read but not edit, Managers/Reviewers approve]
  
  - Published [Everyone can view, Owner/Managers/Reviewers can Edit]

- Workflow mapping - This is the mapping to the different types:

  Plone Workflow -- PloneHelpCenter, 
                    FAQFolder, HowtoFolder, TutorialFolder, 
                    ErrorRefFolder, HelpLinkFolder, Glossary
                    
  Help Center Workflow -- FAQ, Howto, Tutorial,
                          ErrorReference, HelpLink, Definition
                          
  Not workflowed -- TutorialPage, Attachments

  Comments - SEE BELOW

- Permissions:

  - Members can add FAQ, Howto, Tutorial, ErrorRef, HelpLink, Definition
  
  - They are in-progress by default, if they want to cooperate on these, they
    will need to assign local roles.
    
  - Owners are allowed to edit their docs while published. Requiring them to 
    retract content to update or fix, and then approve again is painful.
    Since the piece of documentation has already been approved by then, it's
    "proven" that it was good enough when it started, it doesn't need to be
    re-verified, in my opinion. Feel free to point out why I'm wrong. :)
    
  - Any logged in Member can add a new FAQ, Howto, Tutorial, ErrorRef, HelpLink
    and Definition, but only the owners of those objects can add the sub-objects
    like TutorialPages and Attachments.
    
  - Tutorial is treated as a *unit*, which is why we don't workflow the 
    TutorialPages. They should just be inheriting the permissions of their 
    container (Tutorial).
    
  - The same goes for HowTos, Attachments aren't workflowed.
