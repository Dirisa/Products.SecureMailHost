PloneSoftwareCenter - Remaining issues

Developer claiming item/comments is in [brackets].

=======
General
=======

- Downloadable File should have a hidden Short Name field, as the filename is
  pulled from the uploaded file anyway.

- RSS feed for Latest Releases, ability to have an RSS feed for every project
  and category too.

=========
Design/UI
=========

- Page that lists all the downloads in a category, with batching. (needs template work)

- Portlet listing the latest published Releases should have Category listed. This
  requires the attribute metadata in the Catalog.

- Now that we have data grids on licenses etc., we should probably clean it up
a bit in the view templates for releases  (show links etc.)

- Need to list the documentation types in the Additional resources box.


====
Misc
====

- DOAP feed support (Description of a Project)
  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-osproj3/
  - This will require us to expand the Software Project schema (Package)
    a bit, to incorporate info about CVS/SVN etc, but it's all useful. :)

- i18n support - right now there is no multilingual support.

- Hard for regular members to find Package after it's been created, before
  it's been published (Standard problem in Plone in general without Workspaces
                        ~limi)

- We may want to use the currentVersions field of a release to mark relases
    which are not currently supported.

- Display of "recommended" in psc_project_view.pt and psc_releasefolder_view.pt.
    How does "recommended" work anyway? (Reviewers can flag something as a best-
    of-breed product, but we need some guidelines for this first. ~limi.
    Absolutely we need some guidelines here, or it's going to be a bloody 
    political mess. - Joel
    Indeed, that's why I haven't put any effort into this part yet ;) - limi)


===========================================
PloneHelpCenter integration considerations:
===========================================

 - Test carefully that all the methods/fields found on the PHC root and used
    as vocabs for contained objects are found in PSC as well, or that they
    are only optionally used.

        - DC metadata 'rights' attribute gets acquired from project/package

        - Importance vocabulary falls back on default Low, Medium, High

        - Versions vocab for PHC items (not the same as versions vocab for
            releases, which relate to which version of Plone it's been
            tested with!) use a catalog search of all releases, in custom
            method getVersions_vocab () in PSCProject.

        - Active versions set in field on PSCProject.


========================
Nice-to-have-but-not-yet
========================

Stuff that should be there eventually - but is probably better handled by Plone(Forge|Collab):

- Mailing list/discussion forums inside of ArchPackages

- Have a marshaller for 'Release'. When you upload a .tgz, .zip, .bz2
  file, it should try to extract the PKGINFO, or maybe setup.py and
  populate the objects.

- Maybe have a custom setup.py that is able to register with plone.org
  and populate the objects (also doing upload, and asking for username
  and password).

- SVN integration, you could be able to do the following:

  - Tag a release in the SVN repository

  - Add a release in Plone

  - Select which tag you want the release to be based on

  - Automatically get tar.gz and .zip files for the release

Dependencies, here's Sidnei's comments:

- Add a 'dependencies' tab to release, that shows the existing
  dependencies on a nice layout and allows for adding a dependency
  directly if the user has permission to do so.

- Filter the 'versions' for a choosen package on 'Dependency', as soon
  as the user chooses a package (maybe using javascript?)

- Add pluggable content creation to a 'Package' (or is that a
  'Release'?), so that an instance of a given object is created and
  initialized as soon as the user creates the object. This should also
  be allowed to change after the object has been added (only allowed
  to enable new features, not disable?).
