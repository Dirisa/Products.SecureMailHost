V2.0

I will release a completely new product.

- I'd like to put a different title on the page and different titles on the singular panels

- API

  - register/unregister skin
  - register/unregister viewlet

- add edit button to each content

- submit to Plone as a portlet proposal

- Also, you mention in the documentation that there are heirarchical content
  panels - I assumed that when you click the 'add panel' button inside a panel
you can do that, but actually it just adds the panel after the one you click.
How do you put panels inside other panels?

  add a new kind of panel - sub-contentpanels, just click a icon, and you can 
work on the new sub-contentpanels. And no need to create a sepreate contentpanels. I just get some ideas to achive this without much effort.
