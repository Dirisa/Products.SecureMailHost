The following is a TODO list dealing with PLFNG features and bugs.
It is organized into these categories:

  "KNOWN ISSUES"

  "BEFORE RELEASE 0.60" (items that are not on the immediate
  critical path, but should be worked soon)
  
  "BEFORE 1.0 FINAL" (items that are not yet allocated to a
  pre-1.0 release, but must be done before the big v1.0 release.
  
  "MAYBE NEVER BUT NICE TO HAVE" (items that are not yet on any 
  critical path)


As you find bugs in PLFNG, please submit them to 
the 'Collective' sourceforge project bug tracker:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=55262&atid=476390

(the Collective is the official home for PLFNG and a variety
of other Plone products)

Also, feel free to email me (mgarnsey@users.sourceforge.net)
about feature requests and/or to volunteer to help!!! 


----------------------------------
  KNOWN ISSUES
----------------------------------
- subfolders of a PLFNG instance do not appear in the
  navtree or global path bar 

- file names beginning with underscore characters
  are listed but cannot be accessed (due to a Plone constraint)

- validation issues wrt 'backup_folder' field
  (field is optional unless fileBackup_enabled is set;
   trailing slash validator fires even when 
   fileBackup_enabled is not set)
   
- The upload file button should be centered in the
  view, not only below 'comments' box 

- on the edit form for a PLFNG instance, the 'id' value 
  is not preserved after returning to the form after
  on validation error (this AT 1.3b4 fixes this) 

- directory creation succeeds but gives an error
   message (not found 404) on Windows 
   (not reproducable yet) 

- empty folders give 404 errors for anonymous

- the add new item menu should be disabled, since 
    plone types cannot be added to a PLFNG

- i18n not complete.

- various problems with filenames containing spaces
  (not an issue on Mac OSX; need to quantify this)


----------------------------------
  BEFORE RELEASE 0.60
----------------------------------
- eliminate external md5, unzip utilities dependencies
  (use python's standard md5, unzip capabilities!)

- resolve any problems wrt filenames containing spaces

- better docs! (specifics tbd)

- display size of contents of child folders within PLFNG folder

- add change history metadata for files
  (to include who/when uploaded or deleted a file, updated metadata, etc) 

- improve the unit testing for catalog action

- add metadata support for folders
 
- add ability to hide files (e.g. 'dot' files like .DS_Store on OSX) 
 
- ???

----------------------------------
  BEFORE 1.0 FINAL
----------------------------------

tbd

----------------------------------
 MAYBE NEVER BUT NICE TO HAVE
----------------------------------

- multi-file select for group action (eg, delete)

- virus scanning of uploaded files

- id / track changes to folder contents

- This probably has *nothing* to do with the PloneLocalFolderNG 
product, but when using a GUI editor (i.e. - Epoz), the "toolbox" which 
provides nice placeholders that make it easy to link to or display an 
image, the PloneLocalFolder content doesn't appear like other content.
This may be too much trouble to consider implementing, but it 
might be something to put as a "caveat" in the README file.

- make path elements clickable (like breadcrumbs)

- sort content across multiple page listings

- filter contents lists by type, size, ???

- comments for folders

- ability to hide files (e.g. 'dot' files like .DS_Store on OSX)

- move file and/or folder 

- unpacking support for package types other than .zip (eg .tgz) file types

- display all metadata (partially implemented now)

- edit all metadata 

- ability to generate MD5 checksum metadata for existing files

- ability to verify current file MD5 checksum against metadata MD5 value

- ability to copy files from PLFNG and paste them elsewhere in the site 
  (as regular Plone Files)
