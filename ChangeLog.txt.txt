    * MemberDataTool.py: removed a spurious declaration of registerType and 
    cleaned up the remaining registerType

    * VariableSchemaSupport.py: fixed declaration for getSchema

    * Extensions/Install.py: fixed portal_types icons for MemberArea and 
    TempFolder

    * types/Member.py: 

        - changed formtooltips from an ObjectField to a BooleanField

        - made mail_me read only and require EDIT_PASSWORD_PERMISSION to write

        - improved validate_id error messages

        - updated migration code to reflect changes to Field.py in Archetypes

    * tests/test.py, test_MemberDataTool.py, test_migration.py: 

        - fixed initialization of Zope in unit tests, so all should run.
        Something in archetypes is messing up test.py, and test_MemberDataTool 
        only works with CMF 1.4, but test_migration now works
