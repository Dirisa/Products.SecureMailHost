Before 1.0
* maybe somehow fix Contents tab, which doesn't highlight properly because
  of using bannerfolder_contents as a substitute for folder_contents
* define permissions for the extra methods in BannerFolder and BannerImage
* make sure the banner images are properly cacheable

Future:
* support "fallback" banners - either a new workflow state or a Boolean flag
* keyword matching, so you get related banners in the style of portlet_related
* optional borders on banners
* limits on banner sizes e.g. "only banners of size 468x60 in this folder"
* Flash support, maybe using the SWF File Zope product
* folder_contents with Method Aliases? (CMF HEAD / 1.5 only)
* text banner support (with Epoz, perhaps)
