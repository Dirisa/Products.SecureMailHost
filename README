INSTALLATION:

  * Zope 2.5.1 - http://www.zope.org

  * Plone 1.0 alpha 4  - http://www.plone.org

  * CMF 1.3 - http://cmf.zope.org

  * ImageMagick on windows or unix: http://www.imagemagick.org/
    PIL / Python Imaging Library don't work with this version of CMFPhoto

  Add and run Extenstions/Install/install as an external method after plone is installed.

KNOWN ISSUES:

After changing the imagesize, the photo_view returns the image in the
wrong size, but after a reload of the page, the image is resized.

The javascript-files used in the slideshow has been removed from Plone,
but I have included them here. There are reported some problems with Netscape
4 crashing. The files are styley.js.dtml and ieemu.js.py.

Some depriticated api-s are also used, but I haven't had the time to hunt
them down. Anyway it should work now.

Size is N/A for some images.
