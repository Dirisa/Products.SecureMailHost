Can I nest some GRUFs?
    Maybe... but what for ?

Does GRUF support nested groups ?
    Nested groups in group-whithin-a-group feature.
    And, yes, GRUF supports it since 1.3 version.

Does GRUF support multiple user sources ?
    Multiple user sources is a feature that would allow you to store users in several userfolders.
    For example, you could have your regular admin users in a standard User Folder, your intranet
    users in an LDAPUserFolder and your extranet users in an SQL-based user folder
    GRUF supports this from version 2.0Beta1.

Can I use GRUF outside Plone ?
    Yes, yes, yes, yes and yes. This is a major design consideration for us.

Is GRUF stable ?
    It's used in a production environment for several major websites. Furthermore, it's qualified to be included
    in Plone 1.1. It's considered reliable enough - except for "Beta" versions, of course.

Is GRUF maintained ?
    Yes, it is, actively. Features (especially regarding useablility) are often 
    added to GRUF. Official releases are considered very stable.

Can I help ?
    Yes, for sure !
    GRUF is an Open-Source project and we, at Ingeniweb, are always happy to help people getting involved
    with our products. Just contact us to submit your ideas, patches or insults ! :-)
    In any case, if you want to work on GRUF's CVS, please work in a branch, never on the HEAD!
    I want this to ensure the latest CVS HEAD is always very stable.
