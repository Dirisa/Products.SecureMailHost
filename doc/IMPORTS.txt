** CSV import **


place your import file in 

INSTANCE_HOME/import/users.csv

place your images in 

INSTANCE_HOME/import/user_files


The importer compares the default member schema to the csv. CSV files will be read in order of schema fields.


The importer will look for files with the following naming scheme: [username]_[fieldname].ext (ext stands for any extension.)
