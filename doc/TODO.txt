TO DO
-----

* Refactor.  It would be nice to separate out a MemberDataBase class
from which potential member classes can inherit. 

* Deletion confirmations.  There should be a "do you really want
to do this?" confirmation before you delete a member, since all their
content gets nuked as well.  Additionally, there should be the option
to assign ownership of their content to somebody else.

* Better UI for the Member state tab.  Currently it uses the same
page as for publishing documents, which is completely inappropriate.

* Better UI at points of integration with Plone.  It's a bit awkward,
for instance, to have the context switch to portal_memberdata when
viewing a Member's information.  

* Allow Member objects to exist outside of MemberDataContainer to
allow for organized Member presentation / UI

* i18N this thing!

* Clean up member_catalog zmi interface to only refer to objects that are indexed there
