This Product would not be possible without Zope, CMF, Plone and Archetypes.
Thanks to everyone involved.

Some page template code and the folder icon under skins/ are derived from
Plone2.0RC3 material that is placed under the GPL by George A. Runyan Jr.,
Alexander Limi and Vidar Andersen.

When coding, I had lots of help from studying the code of the above
mentioned products. In addition, I used CMFBoard by Nikolay Kim as a
reference when trying to figure out how to glue everything together and make
sure things install smoothly.

Many ideas were stolen the AdManager Zope product by Blue Wild Fire.

I initially wanted to name this product BadManner, but smatt on #plone
convinced me that a descriptive name is better.
