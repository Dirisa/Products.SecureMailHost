CMFMember uses workflow to control the fields available
on base_view and base_edit.

Here are the states:

New: A member being created by Anonymous.  There is no
object in acl_users corresponding to such a member.

Pending: A locked member object awaiting approval.  Locking
is done via an automatic workflow transition.  There is no
object in acl_users corresponding to such a member.  If a
Manager creates a new member, the member is automatically
registered; otherwise members must be registered by a manager
via a process analogous to document review.

Registered - public: A registered member connected to a User
object in acl_users.  The requisite object is created upon
registration.  The member appears in catalog searches and people
can access public information about the member (full name, email
address, etc)

Registered - private: A registered member connected to a User
object in acl_users.  The requisite object is created upon
registration.  The member does not appear in catalog searches 
and people can NOT access public information about the member 
(full name, email address, etc)
