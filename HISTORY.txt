History of significant changes for PloneHelpCenter:

   (name of developer listed in brackets)


    - Made reference manual and todo navigation drop-downs select current page
        (optilude)

Post-sprint cleanup of ToDo.txt:

     - BUG: Howtos seem to not pick up the 'versions' defined in the Help Center.
         Check that this works for all content types.

        -> Appears fixed (optilude)
          
  - BUG: Contents tab is visible to normal Members (at least on plone.org)
         - it shouldn't be.
    
        -> Appears fixed (optilude)

  - BUG: Comments on TutorialPages end up on the containerish Tutorial object
         instead, at least on plone.org. It should be possible to add a comment
         to a page.
         
         -> Appears fixed (optilude)

  - BUG: error_reference object has "wrong attachments" tab

         Note the path here - we're calling the howto_attachments!

         /aPloneSite/myHelpCenter/error/anErrorref/howto_attachments

         I get this wrong behavior, when trying to view the
         Attachments tab after creating a *error reference*
         
         -> Fixed now (optilude)

  - "Error on howto_attachments "name 'translate' is not defined"

         FYI: I get the above error when trying to view the
         attachements tab when writing a howto."
         
         -> Appears fixed (optilude)


    - Removed Help Center workflow from TutorialPages for now. They should
      probably just have a simple in-progress/finished marker workflow that
      doesn't really affect permissions, but just whether they are listed
      or not in the index/page navigation. Had to remove it because of permission
      problems right now (if any pages are not published in a Tutorial, you get
      permission denied on the entire Tutorial).

PloneHelpCenter 0.2

    - Added Help Center portlet, this will aggregate published entries
      from all the available Help Centers, and display links to the published 
      help centers. [limi]

    - Added Glossary types, updated Help Center view [limi]

    - Added Link types [Joel]

    - Added ErrorReference types [Joel]

    - Added helpcenter_workflow & associate installation stuff. [Joel]

    - Cleaned up FAQFolder, HowtoFolder, TutorialFolder displays [Joel]

    - Folders now only list visible-to-users content [Joel]

    - Changed how versions are printed on pages: uses getVersions method
      rather than macro. Also, only prints a versions: line if there is
      anything in versions vocabulary--so, to create a help center that
      doesn't really use versions, just leave the vocab for this blank.
      It will still appear on Archetypes' forms, but won't show up
      one view modes [Joel]

    - Cleaned up and refactored text/doc files. [Joel]

    - Made many small API changes throughout. Sorry, but now this
      means that any existing Plone Help Centers will have to be migrated.
      I doubt if there are enough out there to justify making a 
      migration script. The API should be fairly stable from now on,
      but keep in mind this is still only a 0.2 release ;) [Joel]

    - added an optional ReferenceField (controlled in config.py) to cross-
      reference from a PHC-type to another Archetype in the portal. This 
      shouldnt affect existing code. If you have ATReferenceBrowserWidget
      installed its used instead of the dumb default ReferenceWidget.
