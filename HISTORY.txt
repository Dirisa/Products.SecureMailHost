History of significant changes for PloneHelpCenter:

   (name of developer listed in brackets)

PloneHelpCenter 0.2

    - Added Help Center portlet, this will aggregate published entries
      from all the available Help Centers, and display links to the published 
      help centers. [limi]

    - Added Glossary types, updated Help Center view [limi]

    - Added Link types [Joel]

    - Added ErrorReference types [Joel]

    - Added helpcenter_workflow & associate installation stuff. [Joel]

    - Cleaned up FAQFolder, HowtoFolder, TutorialFolder displays [Joel]

    - Folders now only list visible-to-users content [Joel]

    - Changed how versions are printed on pages: uses getVersions method
      rather than macro. Also, only prints a versions: line if there is
      anything in versions vocabulary--so, to create a help center that
      doesn't really use versions, just leave the vocab for this blank.
      It will still appear on Archetypes' forms, but won't show up
      one view modes [Joel]

    - Cleaned up and refactored text/doc files. [Joel]

    - Made many small API changes throughout. Sorry, but now this
      means that any existing Plone Help Centers will have to be migrated.
      I doubt if there are enough out there to justify making a 
      migration script. The API should be fairly stable from now on,
      but keep in mind this is still only a 0.2 release ;) [Joel]

PloneHelpCenter 0.1

    - Development version
