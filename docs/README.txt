    Migration from CMFCollector to PloneCollectorNG is not supported and there are

Bugs:

    Use the Collective bugtracker at http://sf.net/projects/collective to file
    bugreports.  Bug reports through mailinglists are not very much acceptable and
    might be ignored. If you file a bug report than pay attention to the
    following:

        - A bug report should contain a *detailed* description including 
          version numbers, software, tracebacks(!!!!) and related error
          messages(!)

        - Incomplete bug reports are likely to be ignored or rejected.

        - Anonymous bug reports are likely to be ignored (I refuse to 
          fix bugs for ghosts).

        - if *you* have a problem then it is up to *you* to provide the
          necessary informations for me to get the problem fixed. It is not up
          to me to get the required informations from you through an iteration
          of questions back to you. Because *you* want help I do expect that 
          *you* are doing your homework.

   Limited and basic non-commercial support is provided for free through
