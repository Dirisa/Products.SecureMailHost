Installation:
    
  - unpack the archive in the Products folder of your Zope installation
    or your INSTANCE_HOME
 
  - restart Zope

  - installation using Quickinstaller

      - visit the ZMI screen of Plone site and go to the portal_quickinstaller
        tool 

      - select the checkboxes for PloneCollectorNG (and Archetypes) and press
        'Install'

      - select "PCNG Tracker" from the add-list of the folder_contents view
        of a folder and create a new instance

     or 

      - You can also use the Plone frontend. Go to "Plone setup". Choose
        "Add/remove products" and select "PloneCollectorNG" to be (re)installed. 
        That's it. 

Upgrading from a PCNG version earlier than 1.1.2:

  - If you upgrade from a previous version it is strongly recommended to
    to follow the installation notes above (remove PloneCollectorNG
    and re-install it using "Plone Setup")

  - You *MUST* run the unicode migration for *every* PloneCollectorNG
    instance if you are upgrading from versions before 1.1.0 beta3.  To
    perform the unicode migration you must call the "migrateUnicode" method 
    on all collector instances (as Manager or TrackerAdmin):

      http://host:port/plonesite/trackers/MyBugTracker/migrateUnicode.

    This method will convert the collector's transcript to unicode. 

    Once again: THIS STEP IS MANDATORY. Do not file any bug report 
    concerning UnicodeDecodeErrors without having performed this unicode 
    migration. They will be ignored or answered with a "RTFM".

    Before upgrading ***YOU SHOULD PERFORM A BACKUP OF YOUR Data.fs FILE***
 
Upgrading from a PCNG 1.1 to PCNG 1.2:

  - For *every* PloneCollectorNG instance you just call the 'pcng_migrate_120'
    method (through the web). This means you have to call:

        http://host:port/plone_site/pcng_instance/pcng_migrate_120

    Before upgrading ***YOU SHOULD PERFORM A BACKUP OF YOUR Data.fs FILE***
 

Internationalization support:

  - Requires the installation of PlacelessTranslationService (Localizer
    /TranslationService might work too, no support)

  - included language catalogs: DE, FI, NL, CS, ES, JA, PT 

  - to translate the catalog to another language:

    o copy i18n/plonecollectorng-de.po to i18n/plonecollectorng-XX.po
      (where XX is the shortcut for the destination language)

    o translate all msgstr "..." in the copied file

    o create a .mo file for your language:

       msgfmt -o plonecollectorng-XX.mo plonecollectorng-XX.po

    o send me a copy of your translated .po file for inclusion with
      the next PloneCollectorNG release

    o restart Zope and enjoy :-)
