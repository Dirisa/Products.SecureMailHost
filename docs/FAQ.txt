Q: Which Archetypes version is necessary to run PCNG?
A: Archetypes 1.3 is mandatory. Lower version will not run

Q: Which Plone version do I need to run PCNG?
A: Plone 2.X is recommended. The skins of PCNG are designed to be used
   with Plone 2.0. Future versions of PCNG will depend on PCNG V2 functionality
   that is not available with Plone 1.X installations. Plone 1.0 compatiblity
   was never a goal for PCNG and will never be a goal (means no support for
   PCNG/Plone 1.X issues).
