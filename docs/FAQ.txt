Q: Which Archetypes version is necessary to run PCNG?
A: Archetypes 1.3 is mandatory. Lower versions will not run. The reason for this
   restrict requirement is that a lot of the functionality of PCNG's schema editor
   present in PCNG V 1.0 has been moved into the AT 1.3 core.

Q: Which Plone version do I need to run PCNG?
A: Plone 2.X is recommended. The skins of PCNG are designed to be used
   with Plone 2.0. Future versions of PCNG will depend on PCNG V2 functionality
   that is not available with Plone 1.X installations. Plone 1.0 compatiblity
   was never a goal for PCNG and will never be a goal (means no support for
   PCNG/Plone 1.X issues).

Q: How can I set my member collector preferences?
A: Navigate to the collector instance and you should see a link to 
   "My collector preferences" within the user action. Clicking on this
   links will open a form where you can enter your preferences related
   to *all* collector instances (means they are *global* and *not specific*
   to a particular collector instance).
