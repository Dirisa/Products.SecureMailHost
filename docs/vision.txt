PloneSoftwareCenter was primarily written to be used at plone.org;
we hope that it's written in such a way to be useful for other
projects.

This is not intended to compete exactly with SourceForge. It is
intended to be the user-friendly structured information for software
add-on products for Plone.

Ultimately, other things should be addable to the software centers:

* bug trackers (most likely, based on PloneCollectorNG)

* mailing list or forum  (most likely, based on CMFBoard)

PloneSoftwareCenter is also intended as an interim product. We
believe that PloneForge looks like a more promising "software
manager" for Plone, and expect to move plone.org to that when
possible. At this time, this isn't possible, since that has
requirements for TeamSpaces and CMFMembers that would be difficult
to make work on plone.org. We've tried to keep our API matching
theirs to make migration easy in the future.
