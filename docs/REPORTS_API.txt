PloneCollectorNG provides a simple API to create your own reports.

 - look at 'pcng_reports.pt'. The file contains a generic report
   "pcng_show_report?report=open_unassigned". 

 - 'open_unassigned' is a PythonScript in pcng_templates/reports

 - the script performs a search of the pcng_catalog and returns
   a list of find issues (see code for details)

 - 'pcng_show_report' is a generic template that calls the script
   and iterates over the resultset to perform the rendering of the hits

To add your own reports:

 - specify your report as PythonScript and put it into the pcng_templates/reports
   folder

 - add an entry to pcng_reports.pt

That's it.
