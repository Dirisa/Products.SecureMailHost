# PATCH 1
#
# Makes REQUEST available from the Globals module.
#
# It's needed because context is not available in the __of__ method,
# so we can't get REQUEST with acquisition. And we need REQUEST for
# local properties (see LocalPropertyManager.pu).
#
# This patch is at the beginning to be sure code that requires it
# doesn't breaks.
#
# This pach is inspired in a similar patch by Tim McLaughlin, see
# "http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Proposals/GlobalGetRequest".
# Thanks Tim!!
