 This code shouldn't be here but allow people to preview advanced GRUF3    
 features (eg. flexible LDAP searching in 'sharing' tab, ...) in Plone 2,  
 without having to upgrade to Plone 2.1.
                                                                           
 Methods here are monkey-patched by now but will be provided directly by
 Plone 2.1.
 Please forgive this 'uglyness' but some users really want to have full    
 LDAP support without switching to the latest Plone version ! ;)


 BY DEFAULT, this thing is NOT enabled. To enable it, you have to do two
 things:

 * Install the gruf_plone_2_0 skin manually (see README file in this skin)

 * Put a 'preview.txt' file in your GroupUserFolder directory. Unless you
 do so, the monkeypatch won't be applied.


 This stuff is only provided for convenience and should be considered as
 experimental.

    - name
    - email

    This is an 'AND' request.

    If name is provided, then a _fast_ search is performed with GRUF's
    searchUsersByName() method. This will improve performance.

    In any other case, a regular (possibly _slow_) search is performed.
    As it uses the listMembers() method, which is itself based on gruf.getUsers(),
    this can return partial results. This may change in the future.
