Overview

  Plone Help Center is an application designed to aid the documentation of
  Plone, and is used on plone.org to categorize and keep documentation up to
  date. It should be usable for documenting other open source products
  (such as Plone Product add-ons) or even for other documentation projects.

Installation

  You install it the usual way - either using Plone Setup or make an
  External method the CMF way.

Usage

  Plone Help Center has inline documentation, just add a help center.

Requirements

  Archetypes 1.3 or later. At the time of this writing, the most recent
  version was 1.3.0b2.

  PloneHelpCenter has been tested with Plone 2.0.3, though it should
  work with other versions of Plone that use Archetypes 1.3.
