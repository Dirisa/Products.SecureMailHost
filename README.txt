Overview

  Plone Help Center is an application designed to aid the documentation of
  Plone, and is used on plone.org to categorize and keep documentation up to
  date. It should be usable for documenting other open source products
  (such as Plone Product add-ons) or even for other documentation projects.

Installation

  You install it the usual way - either using Plone Setup or make an
  External method the CMF way.

Requirements

  Archetypes 1.3 or later. At the time of this writing, the most recent
  version was 1.3.0b2.

  PloneHelpCenter has been tested with Plone 2.0.3, though it should
  work with other versions of Plone that use Archetypes 1.3.

Usage

  Several types of help documentation are available in a Help Center: 
  
  - FAQ
  
  - HowTo
  
  - Tutorial
  
  - Help Link

  - Error Reference

  Below is a description, usage and example for each type.
  
  Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)
  
    An FAQ is a short question with a 1-2 paragraph answer. You can add several
    questions to a FAQ area and group the questions into sections.
   
    **Example:**
    
    *Question*: What is Plone?
    
    *Answer*: Plone is an open source Enterprise Content Management
    System (CMS) that runs on top of Zope and CMF.
  
  HowTo
  
    A HowTo is a one-page description on how to accomplish something, but is
    folderish, so Files/Images can be attached.
  
    **Examples:** 
  
    - How to run Plone with Apache
   
    - How to change the tabs that appear at the top of the portal
  
  Tutorial 
  
    A tutorial is a multi-paged article with lots of detail. The tutorial is
    more in depth and may cover the conceptual aspects of the task, in addition
    to the practical steps to get the job done.
   
    **Examples:**
  
    - How to utilize workflows in your projects
   
    - Explaining the separation of content, logic and presentation

  Help Link

    A help link is a link (either external or internal). It is
    different than a standard Plone link in that it can have sections
    and versions information.

  Error Reference

    An error reference is meant to be the explanation of a particular
    error.
