 How to make more viewlets?

  Viewlet is a view of content which can be selected in contentpanels. Viewlet
can be a zpt or a zpt macro. Viewlets are registered with CMF Action
mechanism.

  1. Write a viewlet for your content.  Viewlet structure is the same to 
    "Plone 2 portlet":http://plone.org/Members/arnia/plone2-css-reference/Portlets/wikipage_view.
You can refer to stuff at \CMFContentPanels\skins\contentpanels\viewlets,
where are default viewlets.

  2. Add a new CMF action with the CMF Action mechanism. Remember, the action
catalog should be 'panel_viewlets'. See the Install.py for detail

 How to add new panel skin?

  You can define a new css wrapper to define a new panel skin:

  1. customise contentpanels_skin.css.dtml, write your new css wrapper there
    
  2. go to ZMI 'portal_contentpanels', in the properties view, add your new
wrapper there.
