Overview

  PloneSoftwareCenter is a tool to keep track of software projects and software
  releases, and is used to power the Products download area on plone.org.

  It was formerly called ArchPackage.

Installation

  Install as a usual Plone Product. If you have Plone Help Center
  installed, you get the ability to add documentation objects inside
  the Software Projects.

  - Requires Plone 2.0.1 or higher

  - Requires Archetypes 1.3.2 or higher

  - Requires ExternalStorage if you want files stored on FS instead of in the
    ZODB.

  - Requires ArchAddOn from Collective.

  - Can optionally use PloneHelpCenter to provide package-specific help
    containers.
