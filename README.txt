Sime cookie-based poll product based on Archetypes
http://www.sf.net/projects/archetypes

Normal CMF-product install procedure.

Add here/mpoll_slot/macros/voteBox to left_slots or right_slots, and a box
will display all running polls (published, not expired) for the users to vote on.  

If you use plone2, you can use here/portlet_mpoll/macros/portlet instead.

Expire the poll to close it.
