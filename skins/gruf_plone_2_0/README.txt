Here is the placeholder for files providing Plone 2.0 compatibility for GRUF 3.

This is the case, for example, for local roles form or control panel stuff.

This skin is NOT installed by default. If you want to use it, you have to take
a look at GRUF's main README and install it manually (with an External Method
provided in the 'Extensions' directory of this product).

Of course, do not use this skin for Plone 2.1 or Plone < 2.0... If you once
migrate from Plone 2.0 to Plone 2.1, don't forget to uninstall it !

Enjoy ! ;-)
