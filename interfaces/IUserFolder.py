"""
VOCABULARY:

  - [Pure] User: A user is a user atom who can log itself on, and
    have additional properties such as domains and password.

  - Group: A group is a user atom other atoms can belong to.

  - User atom: Abstract representation of either a User or
    a Group.

  - Member (of a group): User atom inside a group.

  - Name (of an atom): For a user, the name can be set by
    the underlying user folder but usually id == name.
    For a group, its id is prefixed, but its name is NOT prefixed by 'group_'.
    For method taking a name instead of an id (eg. getUserByName()),
    if a user and a group have the same name,
    the USER will have precedence over the group.
