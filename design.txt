Here are the main and initial ideas behing GRUF :

   First, we did spend a lot of time be fore starting to write this
component. We've had a lot of design (yes, using paper and pen ;)),
thinking a lot on how to be as much generic as possible . So the
conclusion of our design sessions were :
  
  - a group has to be seen by zope like an user. This way, we can
garantee that the _whole_ standar d security machinery of Zope will
continue to work like a charm, without even an hotfix.
  
   - a first consequence of this is that GRUF will work out of the box
   with any Zope application ; including Plone ;)
   
   - a second consequence is : groups just have to be stored into
   another acl_users
  
  - GRUF must use _any_ existing acl_users component ; including LDAP
  or sql one
  
  - GRUF as to be as transparent as possible to applications (read
  "should act as a normal user folder")
  
  - Groups nesting should be supported
  
  - Multiple sources for users should be supported (ex : source 1 is
  SQL, source 2 is LDAP, source 3 is another LDAP).
  
  API was designed. Test cases were written. Code was done.
Documentation was written. First version went out. First customers
were (very) happy. In this order ;)
