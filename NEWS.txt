1.0fork-rc2 - 2004-03-01

    Fixed bug in FasterStringIO that added new lines to the output

    Added zope 3 like locales directory support:
      Products/MyProduct/locales/${lang}/LC_MESSAGES/${domain}.po

1.0fork-rc1 - 2004-02-11

    Fixed minors problems with python 2.1 compatibility

1.0fork-beta5 - 2004-02-03

    Added utranslate method

    Added negotiator chains and two new easy negotiators

    Added zope 3 like MessageID and MessageIDFactory

    Updated API and cleaned up code:
      - added security to classes
      - moved some classes to utils.py to avoid method level imports
      - added getTranslationService() method to get the PTS instance
        in other products

1.0fork-beta4 - 2004-01-28

    Read all files with "rb" in msgfmt.py

    Display broken Message Catalogs in ControlPanel as "broken"

    Synced with these latest PTS changes from savannah:
      - added as_unicode argument to translate
      - cleaned up msgfmt.py

1.0fork-beta3 - 2004-01-07

    Added a builtin mo compiler based on the msgfmt tool from the python source
    package. No need to compile the po files to mo files. Thanks to
    Christian 'Tiran' Heimes <ch@comlounge.net>

    No longer load mo files on startup. Catalogs are automatically compiled.

1.0fork-beta2 - 2003-11-24

    No longer register a persistent service to zope translation
    service registry. Instead wrap PTS with a non persistent class

    Added a de (German) translation for PTS ZMI

    Reimplemented hook to register own negotiaton method into 
    Negotiator which was stripped out in 1.0beta1 (now works
    with PloneLanguageTool again)

    Python 2.1 compatibility

1.0beta1 - 2003-10-??

    Internationalized our own page templates (for ZMI) and added a
    pt_BR translation

    Generalized the Negotiator so that it may negotiate any header in
    the "accept" format

1.0alpha2 - 2003-09-26

    Some primitive DTML support

    Fixed persistence issues that were arising from having the same
    object stored in the ZODB and in a module-level global var (thanks
    to Sidnei)

1.0alpha1 - 2003-08-27

    Removed dependency from PAX

    Now PTS looks for an "i18n" subdirectory under each Product
    package, which makes it easier to package/install i18n-aware
    products.  The i18n dir on INSTANCE_HOME is still kept, you can
    use it for local overrides

    Improvements on the ZMI usability

0.5 - 2003-03-31

    Now we have a ZMI (Zope Management Interface) in Zope's Control
    Panel.  You can use it to refresh catalogs without restarting, and
    to test installed catalogs

    Some functions at module-level are exported for use in Python
    Scripts and Page Templates (Open or Z): negotiate(), translate(),
    getLanguages(), getLanguageName()

    Added a "hotfix" to StringIO that should make PTS work with ZPT
    without UnicodeError being raised constantly

0.4 - 2003-02-03

    Relicensed to GPL

    Now it really works with ZPT (thoroughly tested)

    If used with OpenPT, it will use the output encoding negotiation
    hooks

    Negotiator now uses a cache (stored in the request) to speed
    things up

    Can now use multiple catalogs for the same domain (but the order
    in which they are checked is a bit randomic)

    Special thanks to Magnus Heino for the ZPT support hints and
    patches

0.3 - 2003-01-02

  This release marked the split of PlacelessTranslationService into
  its own package, and the initial attempts at making it compatible
  with ZPT.

0.2 - 2002-09-22

  Updated release

0.1 - 2002-08-24

  Initial release
