	* ReservedTypes.py (ReserverMixin.allowedContentTypes): Changed to
	use InheritanceUtils.getAttrNotFromBase().  This is a raging
	debate, leave it up to the programmer to reconcile multiple
	definitions of allowedContentTypes() or take care of it here.  I
	decided most recently to take care of it here because this is a
	_mixin_ class and doesn't subclass a class that defines the method
	itself, and yet as a mixin its _supposed_ to override an existing
	method def.  We'll see if this logic holds :)

	We'll still keep filterReservedTypes() arround in case someone
	ever needs it.
