    * Fixed getPersonalPortrait in MembershipTool.py

2003-12-11  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

    * Fixed ownership of member objects after copy / rename

    * Check for presence of portal_groups in MemberDataTool in case we're
      working with Plone 1.0.x.

    * Applied some fixes contributed by Robert Rotterman and Volodymyr 
      Cherepanyak:

    * Modified methods used in Member.py to access and set user passwords / 
      roles / domains to make things work with GRUF.

    * Fixed Member.getSchema so that things work with users defined outside the
      portal acl_users folder.

    * Fixed migration in MemberData to work better with GRUF

    * Modified MemberData.getProperty so that it first looks for default values
      in MemberData properties and then falls back to the defaults defined in
      the Member object schema.  This lets one set member defaults TTW.

    * Factory tool now gives ownership of new objects to the currently 
      authenticated member.

    * Modified MemberData.getProperty and Member.getProperty to make them 
      consistent with the CMFCore behavior when a Member property is not found.

    * Added a missing import to Member.py.

    * Made some fixes to Install to make re-installations work.

    * Made Member.getRoles and Member.getDomains public for consistency with
      CMFCore MemberData.

    * Added mechanism to log tracebacks for exceptions thrown by methods called 
      by workflow to aid in debugging (ideally we should filter out 
      ConflictErrors).

    * Refactored test.py into a sequence of standalone tests.  All tests 
      now run except for test_MemberData (and this might run with CMF 1.4 --
      I haven't checked).

2003-06-24  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

    * Removed test for mail_me from Member.register().  If you want to test for
      the mail_me flag, at the very least, make sure that the user had the
      ability to modify their password at startup (check the permissions).
      Alternatively, you can customize the registration tool's registeredNotify
      or override register in a subclass.

2003-06-22  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

    * Fixed tabs in portal_memberdata.  You now will get the standard tabs after
      creation.  Adding actions now works, too.

    * Enabled the option to mail your password to yourself when you change it.

    * Minor code cleanup in the factory tool.

    * Code cleanup in the main test (which still doesn't run because of some
      evil code in Archetypes)

2003-06-13  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

    * Fixed a couple of pretty serious bugs in Member.py that had to do with
      deleting members with user objects that come from outside the current
      portal.  First, the test for the source of the user objects' acl_users 
      folder was broken, which meant that one could delete the site administrator.
      Even worse, when one deleted the site administrator, all the objects they
      owned were deleted recursively, which included the portal itself!  This
      wreaked all sorts of havoc and is now fixed.

    * Updated skins/content_edit.py to work with changes in Archetypes'
      handling of schemata

2003-06-10  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

    * MemberDataTool.py: removed a spurious declaration of registerType and 
    cleaned up the remaining registerType

    * VariableSchemaSupport.py: fixed declaration for getSchema

    * Extensions/Install.py: fixed portal_types icons for MemberArea and 
    TempFolder

    * types/Member.py: 

        - changed formtooltips from an ObjectField to a BooleanField

        - made mail_me read only and require EDIT_PASSWORD_PERMISSION to write

        - improved validate_id error messages

        - updated migration code to reflect changes to Field.py in Archetypes

    * tests/test.py, test_MemberDataTool.py, test_migration.py: 

        - fixed initialization of Zope in unit tests, so all should run.
        Something in archetypes is messing up test.py, and test_MemberDataTool 
        only works with CMF 1.4, but test_migration now works
