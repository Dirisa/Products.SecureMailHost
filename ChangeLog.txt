   - I found PURGE wasn't always work. After a look at squid's client.c,
     I found we should use HTTP/1.0, and use the full url when put request.

     So I change the squid urls to squid hosts. And prune url should be 
     the full absolute url, but not the relative path.
 
   - don't use getObject, use getURL instead, which is more light weight

   - add i18n
   - add skin for plone
   - refine the prune logic
